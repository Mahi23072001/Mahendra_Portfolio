                <p>
                    I'm Going to tell you a very brief intro about me in this section. Currently, I am an undergraduate b.tech student of IIT Jodhpur, Rajasthan.<br> I loved to play indoor games like-,<em> Chess, Carrom Board etc.</em> Sometimes when
                    I feel alone and want to share my thoughts then I convey it with the help of my Drawings or you can say art and crafts. I also do some kind of video/audio editing in my free time.<br> <br>After joining my college I participated in
                    various activities and sports like Athletics which helped me in growing my knowledge and skills and most importantly building confidence and connecting with others. In college I when I feel dis-separated from family sometimes then
                    I write poems, Shayari, etc.. and share them with them. I learned various technical software and a lot of technical knowledge in various fields and explore them as far as I can. Finally, I just learned one thing from my life and that
                    is :<br>
                    <br><em>“The thing you feared most is always going to way you have to follow one day. You have to face it one day, and that day you can't deny it.”</em>
